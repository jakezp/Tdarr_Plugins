# FileFlow vs Tdarr Comparison

## Ease of Use

### Tdarr
- **Visual Flow Builder**: Tdarr's flow-based UI allows you to visually construct processing pipelines, which can be easier to understand for complex workflows
- **Learning Curve**: Steeper initial learning curve due to the many options and configuration possibilities
- **UI Complexity**: More complex UI with multiple tabs and configuration screens
- **Docker Support**: Well-documented Docker setup, but requires more configuration

### FileFlow
- **Simplified Interface**: More streamlined, focused interface with less cognitive overhead
- **Quick Setup**: Generally faster to get up and running with basic functionality
- **Configuration**: Uses a simpler YAML-based configuration approach
- **Docker Integration**: Very Docker-friendly with simpler setup process

## Plugin Support

### Tdarr
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Larger community plugin ecosystem with hundreds of plugins
- **Plugin Types**: Supports both "Classic" plugins (JavaScript) and "Flow" plugins (TypeScript)
- **Custom Development**: More complex plugin development process but more powerful capabilities
- **Community**: Larger community contributing plugins and solutions

### FileFlow
- **Plugin System**: Simpler plugin system focused on specific tasks
- **Integration**: Better native integration with tools like Sonarr/Radarr
- **Development**: Easier to develop simple plugins but less powerful for complex operations
- **Community**: Smaller but growing community

## Extensibility

### Tdarr
- **Customization**: Highly customizable with the ability to create complex processing chains
- **Flexibility**: Can handle very complex media processing scenarios
- **Integration**: Can integrate with many external tools but sometimes requires more setup
- **Scaling**: Better for large libraries with complex processing needs

### FileFlow
- **Simplicity**: Easier to extend for basic functionality
- **API**: Cleaner API for basic integrations
- **Automation**: Better out-of-the-box automation with watch folders
- **Scaling**: Better for simpler, focused workflows

## Performance

### Tdarr
- **Resource Usage**: Can be more resource-intensive
- **Parallel Processing**: Strong parallel processing capabilities
- **Large Libraries**: Better handling of very large media libraries
- **Monitoring**: More detailed monitoring and statistics

### FileFlow
- **Lightweight**: Generally more lightweight and efficient for basic operations
- **Speed**: Faster for simple operations like remuxing
- **Resource Management**: Better default resource management
- **Simplicity**: Less overhead for simple tasks

## Recommendation

- **Choose Tdarr if**: You need complex media processing workflows, have a large library with diverse needs, want extensive customization, or need the larger plugin ecosystem
- **Choose FileFlow if**: You prefer simplicity, need tight integration with *arr apps, want faster setup and operation for basic tasks, or have simpler media processing needs

## Current Project Context

Since you've already invested time in creating Tdarr flows, the decision might depend on your specific needs. If your current workflows are working well but just need optimization, staying with Tdarr makes sense. If you're finding Tdarr overly complex for your needs, FileFlow might be worth exploring.

## Specific Use Cases

### Tdarr Excels At
- Complex multi-step processing workflows
- Handling diverse media formats and codecs
- Detailed control over encoding parameters
- Managing very large media libraries
- Custom plugin development for specialized needs

### FileFlow Excels At
- Quick setup and configuration
- Seamless integration with Sonarr/Radarr workflows
- Simpler media standardization tasks
- Lower resource usage for basic operations
- More intuitive interface for beginners

## Conclusion

Both tools have their strengths and are designed for somewhat different use cases. Tdarr offers more power and flexibility at the cost of complexity, while FileFlow prioritizes simplicity and integration at the cost of some advanced features. Your choice should be based on your specific media processing needs, technical comfort level, and desired workflow complexity.
